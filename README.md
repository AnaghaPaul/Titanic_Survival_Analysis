# Unequal Chances: How Class and Gender Shaped Titanic Survival Rates

This project explores how social class, gender, and age influenced survival outcomes during the Titanic disaster. What began as a learning exercise evolved into a deeper analysis of how societal structures and evacuation priorities shaped life-or-death outcomes.

Using the Kaggle Titanic dataset, this analysis combines data exploration, visualization, and storytelling to uncover meaningful patterns behind survival rates.

## Introduction

The sinking of the Titanic is often remembered as a tragic accident, but survival was not purely random. This project analyzes survival patterns to understand how demographic factors—particularly gender, age, and passenger class—affected survival probabilities.

The analysis highlights how social norms such as *“women and children first”* and class-based access to resources played a decisive role in determining who lived and who did not.

## Need of Study

Understanding survival patterns in the Titanic dataset helps illustrate how social inequality can influence outcomes even in crisis situations. This study demonstrates how data can be used to uncover hidden biases and structural advantages, making it a powerful example of exploratory data analysis and data storytelling.

## Dataset

- Source: Kaggle Titanic Dataset
- Records: Passenger-level data
- Key fields:
  - Sex
  - Age
  - Passenger Class (Pclass)
  - Survival Status

The dataset provides a structured way to analyze demographic disparities and their impact on survival rates.

## Tools & Techniques

- Python (data analysis)
- Pandas (data manipulation)
- Tableau (interactive visualization)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Comparative analysis across demographic groups

---

## Key Insights

- Only **1 out of 4 men survived**, compared to **3 out of 4 women**
- In **1st class**:
  - ~3.8 out of 4 women survived
  - ~1.47 out of 4 men survived
- In **3rd class**:
  - ~2 out of 4 women survived
  - Only ~0.54 out of 4 men survived
- Social class significantly amplified survival disparities, especially for men

## Conclusion

The findings clearly show that survival on the Titanic was shaped by more than chance. Gender, age, and class played critical roles, reinforcing how societal hierarchies and evacuation norms influenced outcomes.

This project demonstrates how data analysis can move beyond numbers to tell meaningful stories about inequality, decision-making, and human behavior in historical events.
